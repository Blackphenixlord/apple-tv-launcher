| | Original | Apple TV Launcher |
|---|---|---|
| **Focus** | A glass box that springs from tile to tile | No box: the icon itself lifts, leans toward the press and settles, with a moving highlight, like the tvOS focus engine |
| **Top bar** | Greeting, large clock and date; text pills | Round Liquid Glass buttons (sound, Customize, Inputs, Settings) and a glass clock with AM/PM; the clock opens a large panel with seconds |
| **Dock** | Four apps, the focused app's name in large type above it | Six apps, an even glass margin, rounder icons; **Down slides the dock to the top** with every app row under it |
| **Grid** | Name under each tile on focus | Larger tiles, only the focused app named, a nudge at the end of a row |
| **Sound** | System clicks | A soft tick between icons and a pop on opening an app, with a bell button to silence them |
| **Background** | Colour glow, wallpaper or a theme | Apple aerials playing behind Home: pick one or **cycle through them all** from the Background menu |
| **Type** | Outfit | Inter Display and Inter Text in place of SF Pro, tabular figures on the clocks |

## Screenshots

## The top-right controls

Five Liquid Glass controls sit in the corner, the way Apple TV puts them. Press Up from the dock to reach them;
each lifts and leans as it takes focus, just like the app icons.

| Clock | Inputs |
|---|---|
| ![The clock opened: a glass panel with the time to the second and the date](docs/fork/clock.jpg) | ![The Inputs menu: HDMI ports by device name and Live TV](docs/fork/inputs.jpg) |
| **Clock.** Select the time for a larger panel with seconds and the date. Down or Left closes it and moves on. | **Inputs.** Every HDMI port under its device's name (here a PlayStation 5, marked Connected) and Live TV. Left or Right leaves the menu. |

| Silence | Settings |
|---|---|
| ![The bell button showing the silenced bell with a slash](docs/fork/silenced.jpg) | ![The Settings menu: TV settings, edit dock, reorder apps, background, top icons, sounds, module cards](docs/fork/settings-menu.jpg) |
| **Sounds.** The bell turns all of Home's sounds off and on; silenced, it shows the bell with a slash. Hold OK on it for the Sounds panel. | **Settings.** Press for the launcher's menu: TV settings, Edit dock, Reorder apps, Background, Top icons, Sounds and Module cards. Hold OK to go straight to the Android TV settings. |

**Customize** (the arrows) rearranges the apps: OK picks one up, the arrows move it, Back places it.

Don't want them all? Open **Settings**, then **Top icons**, to show or hide Inputs, Customize, the sound bell and the clock. Settings always stays.

| Top icons | Sounds |
|---|---|
| ![Top icons: Inputs, Switch apps, Sound and Clock, each Shown or Hidden](docs/fork/top-icons.jpg) | ![Sounds: All sounds, Navigation sound and App open sound, each On or Off](docs/fork/sounds.jpg) |
| **Settings → Top icons.** Show or hide Inputs, Customize, the sound bell and the clock. | **Settings → Sounds**, or hold OK on the bell. All sounds at once, or the navigation tick and the app open pop separately. |

## Animated backgrounds

![The Background menu: Cycle through all marked Playing, then each aerial by name](docs/fork/background.jpg)

Apple's aerials play behind Home as moving video. Open **Settings** and choose **Background**:

- **Cycle through all.** Each aerial plays through once, then Home fades to the next, round the list.
- **Or pick one** (North America Aurora, Hawaii, New York Night, London, Korea and Japan Night, Antarctica,
  Dubai) to keep it on a loop. The choice is remembered.

The menu lists whatever aerials are on the TV (`files/aerials`, with their names in `aerials.json`); the
installer puts them there.

## Install

Setup is the same as the original's. In short: switch on USB debugging on the TV, then give
[`PROMPT.md`](PROMPT.md) to a coding assistant on a computer on the same Wi-Fi, or follow
[Doing it by hand](#doing-it-by-hand) to build and install the launcher yourself:

```bash
export TV_HOST=192.168.1.50                    # your TV's IP address
TV_HOST=$TV_HOST launcher/build-and-install.sh # build the launcher and make it Home
```

Everything you change (dock apps, columns, hidden apps, remote keys) lives in
`launcher/app/src/main/res/values/config.xml`. The full guide follows below.

# Setup guide

*From the original project. Setup, supported TVs and restoring apply to this fork unchanged; "What you get" and "The launcher" describe the original design, and the table above lists what this fork does differently.*

## How it works

Android TVs have the same debug bridge as Android phones. Switch on USB debugging in the TV's
developer options, allow your computer once, and the rest is standard Android tooling:

1. **Back up** the list of installed packages and settings.
2. **Disable** the manufacturer's telemetry, ad services, content rows and preloaded junk with
   `pm disable-user`. Nothing is uninstalled, so a restore script can undo every step.
3. **Install** a small native launcher and make it the default home screen.

**No root, no cable, nothing uninstalled, and a one-line restore if you change your mind.**

The bloat differs by brand, so the prompt has your coding assistant discover it on your TV and ask
before touching anything you might use.

## Quick start

You need a computer on the same Wi-Fi as the TV and a coding assistant with shell access.
Suggested: Claude Code on [0G Private Computer](https://pc.0g.ai), one API key for 100+ models.
Claude Code with an Anthropic plan, Codex or Gemini CLI work too.

| | |
|---|---|
| **1. On the TV** | Settings → Device Preferences → About → press OK on **Build** seven times → back → Developer options → **USB debugging** on. If you see a Network or ADB debugging toggle, turn that on too. Keep the TV on. |
| **2. On your computer** | Paste [`PROMPT.md`](PROMPT.md) into your assistant and fill in your TV model. |
| **3. Follow along** | Accept "Allow USB debugging?" on the TV, then answer the checklist: which apps you use, which four go in the dock, whether to keep the voice assistant, Chromecast and updates. |

The assistant backs up, debloats, builds and installs the launcher, and checks each step with
screenshots pulled from the TV. With this repo as context it takes about fifteen minutes.

## What you get

- **A pitch-black home** with a dock of your four favourite apps in a rounded band, where Apple TV puts it.
- **A top shelf** naming the focused app in large type, with an ambient glow in a colour taken from its artwork.
- **The rest of your apps in a grid** that slides up when you press Down.
- **One floating glass highlight** that springs from tile to tile. The focused tile lifts and shows its name.
- **Three frosted buttons**: Inputs (HDMI ports under the names you gave them in the TV's settings, AV, Live TV), Wi-Fi or Ethernet with the network name, Settings.
- **A greeting, a thin clock and the date** in [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit), and a matching Clock screensaver. Set `show_stats` in config or a theme for one line under the clock: CPU, free memory and free storage. It stays off unless you turn it on, and it refreshes only while Home is on screen.
- **Themes** that change colours, wallpaper, dock and columns without a rebuild, and **module cards** that let other apps plug a tile in, only with your say-so.

And a TV that stops working against you: no sponsored rows, no "Discover" nags, no analytics
phoning home, no apps you never asked for.

## Supported TVs

Anything running **Android TV** or **Google TV**. Samsung (Tizen) and LG (webOS) run different
systems; see [SHOWCASE.md](SHOWCASE.md) for a webOS port. **Fire TV** takes the debloat half only,
since Fire OS will not hand Home to a third-party launcher. A few China-market TCL sets refuse to
install any launcher at all; their lists say so in the header.

## Doing it by hand

Everything the assistant does, you can run yourself. The tools need Python 3 and nothing else.

```bash
python3 -m venv tools/venv && tools/venv/bin/pip install -r tools/requirements.txt
export TV_HOST=192.168.1.50                                   # your TV's IP address

tools/venv/bin/python -I tools/tv.py --probe                 # model, Android version, firmware
tools/venv/bin/python -I tools/tv.py 'pm list packages'      # one shell command on the TV
tools/disable.sh examples/xiaomi-mi-tv-4a/debloat.txt        # apply a debloat list
tools/restore.sh examples/xiaomi-mi-tv-4a/debloat.txt        # undo it, stock launcher back
TV_HOST=192.168.1.50 launcher/build-and-install.sh           # build the launcher and make it Home
tools/theme.sh themes/aurora                                 # push a theme; --reset removes it
```

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`tools/tv.py`](tools/tv.py) | Pure-Python ADB client: shell, batch, push, pull. Works where the stock `adb` binary is blocked. |
| [`tools/b64push.py`](tools/b64push.py) | Uploads large files such as APKs in base64 chunks and verifies the checksum. |
| [`tools/disable.sh`](tools/disable.sh), [`restore.sh`](tools/restore.sh) | Apply or undo a debloat list, the undo from the state recorded before the change. |
| [`tools/recovery.py`](tools/recovery.py) | Writes the record `disable.sh` needs to undo itself, and prints the restore batch. |
| [`tools/theme.sh`](tools/theme.sh) | Push a folder from [`themes/`](themes/) to the launcher and restart Home. |
| [`tools/race_calendar.py`](tools/race_calendar.py) | Writes this season's F1 calendar into a theme for race-weekend mode, from the free Jolpica API. |
| [`launcher/build-and-install.sh`](launcher/build-and-install.sh) | Builds a shrunk release (about 390 KB), installs it, switches Home, and rolls back if Home does not land on it. |

Debloat list paths passed to `disable.sh` and `restore.sh` are relative to the directory you run
from, so your own lists can live outside the repository. Absolute paths also work.

Every script has a PowerShell twin next to it. On Windows with Android Studio installed nothing
else is needed:

```powershell
python -m venv tools\venv; tools\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r tools\requirements.txt
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File launcher\build-and-install.ps1 -TvHost 192.168.1.50
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\disable.ps1 -TvHost 192.168.1.50 examples\xiaomi-mi-tv-4a\debloat.txt
```

The install scripts ask the TV which launcher owns Home and only disable one they recognise
(`tvlauncher` or `launcherx`); pass `STOCK_LAUNCHER=<package>` (`-StockLauncher`) to override, or
`none` to leave it alone.

`tools/disable.sh` (`disable.ps1`) applies the same rule before it disables anything: if the list
contains the app that owns Home and no other app on the TV answers HOME, it skips that entry, says
why, and disables the rest of the list. So a list applied before the launcher handover cannot leave
the TV with nothing to start. Run the same list again once `launcher/build-and-install.sh` has made
the new launcher Home and the entry is applied; `FORCE_HOME=1` (`$env:FORCE_HOME`) disables it anyway.

## The launcher

A small native Android TV app (`com.gathin.tvhome`, about 390 KB installed) in plain Java with
AndroidX RecyclerView and nothing heavier. Built for sets with 1 GB of RAM: no blur, no video, no
network, no background services. It needs JDK 17 and Android SDK platform 34 to build; on macOS,
`brew install openjdk@17 android-commandlinetools` and `sdkmanager "platforms;android-34" "build-tools;34.0.0"`. On Linux
the install script finds `~/Android/Sdk` and the `java` on your PATH.

- **Configure** in [`config.xml`](launcher/app/src/main/res/values/config.xml): dock order, hidden apps, the Live TV package, columns (tiles shrink from 5 up), rows under the dock, an optional VPN app for the network pill, and `reduced_motion` for TVs whose GPU cannot keep up.
- **App library (optional):** enable `app_library` in config.xml or a theme to browse installed apps and add or remove Home shortcuts with the remote. See [the app library guide](docs/app-library.md).
- **On-TV launcher settings:** click Settings for the TV's system settings, or hold OK on Settings and choose Launcher settings to set 4, 5, 6 or 7 apps per row, turn animations on or off, and opt into advanced effects. The advanced option adds tile lift, icon zoom and smooth ambient-colour transitions; it may use more memory. Use Follow theme to clear on-TV choices. Pushing or resetting a theme also clears them.
- **Change the default home:** Launcher settings and the optional Default-home tile (`show_home_settings_shortcut`) open Android's home picker. Choose the original launcher to stop using CleanYourTV as Home, or CleanYourTV to return. The original launcher must be enabled. If the install script disabled it, use the restore script below first. Some TVs provide no home picker.
- **Themes** set the same keys plus a background colour and a wallpaper from a `config.json` pushed to the TV, no rebuild. Four ship in [`themes/`](themes/), documented there.
- **Language** follows the TV: English, German, Spanish, Catalan, French, Russian, Serbian (Latin), Polish, Czech, Portuguese, Turkish, Arabic, Hebrew, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese (Taiwan), Thai, Finnish, Vietnamese, Bangla. Android 13+ can set it for the launcher alone: `tools/tv.py 'cmd locale set-app-locales com.gathin.tvhome --locales ca'`.
  Hebrew places the menu buttons on the left and the date and clock on the right, with the greeting above the clock. The Clock screensaver right-aligns its date and time, and Hebrew dates include the month prefix ב (for example, 19 באוקטובר). Hebrew dock and app-grid rows start on the right, with matching left/right remote navigation. The Hebrew input selector places icons and labels on the right, status on the left, and aligns the dropdown with the Inputs button’s right edge. Other languages keep their original layouts.
  Russian includes the module-card approval and management screens and the VPN-off badge.
- **Module cards** let any TV app declare its own tile (label, caption, glow). The launcher asks you once per app, Keep hidden by default, and remembers the answer for that app's signing key and card name. Hold OK on Settings and choose Module cards to change your mind. How to make one: [`docs/modules.md`](docs/modules.md); the contract: [`docs/specs/card.md`](docs/specs/card.md).
- **Clock screensaver**: a drifting clock over the glow, so nothing burns in. Pick "Clock" in the TV's screensaver settings, or over ADB:
  `tools/tv.py 'settings put secure screensaver_components com.gathin.tvhome/.ClockDream; settings put secure screensaver_enabled 1'`
- **Remote keys**: an optional accessibility service keeps the remote's Input button working on Google TV (`INPUT_KEY_SERVICE=1` at install) and can bring back other buttons only the stock launcher answered, such as the YouTube button (`app_keys` and `input_key_keycodes`, in `config.xml` or a theme; `HOME_KEY_SERVICE=1` reads `app_keys` too), another fixes sticks whose Home key sends ALL_APPS and opens Settings from the remote's gear button, even one Android does not map (`HOME_KEY_SERVICE=1`, scancodes or keycodes in `config.xml`). With `settings_key_panel` the gear opens a [small quick settings panel](docs/quick-settings-panel.jpg) instead, over Home or any app: TV settings, Display, Network, Apps and Launcher settings.
- **Navigation** is deliberate: Up and Down move one row, the top buttons never fall through to tiles and Down from them returns to the dock tile you came from, the last focused app is remembered, and installing or removing an app refreshes the tiles while Home is open.
- **Artwork**: app banners load at xhdpi or better, so low-density TV UIs do not downsample them before the focus zoom.

## Restoring your TV

Before `tools/disable.sh` changes anything it writes down what the TV looked like: for every package
in the list whether it was enabled, already disabled or not installed, which component owned Home,
and the three animation scales. That record lives in `~/.cleanyourtv/`, one file per TV and list, and
a second run of the same list keeps the first record instead of saving the cleaned-up state over it.
If you added packages to the list since, that run adds them to the record before disabling them.

Keep the list you applied. The restore script replays the record, so a package you had disabled
yourself stays disabled and Home goes back to the component that owned it:

```bash
TV_HOST=192.168.1.50 tools/restore.sh examples/<your tv>/debloat.txt                                    # Android TV
TV_HOST=192.168.1.50 tools/restore.sh examples/<your tv>/debloat.txt com.google.android.apps.tv.launcherx  # Google TV
```

The `stock launcher` argument is only a fallback: with a record, the launcher that actually owned Home
is the one that gets it back, and the argument is used only when nothing answered HOME at the time
or this project's launcher owned it. The stock launcher is enabled again either way, unless it was
already disabled when the record was taken.
Without a record (an older run, or a record you deleted) the script says so and falls back to
enabling the whole list and resetting the scales to `1.0`, which is what it used to do.

It leaves the new launcher installed (remove it from the TV's Settings → Apps if you want it gone)
and does not know about packages you disabled outside the list. To switch back later, run the
install script again; it works out which launcher to disable even when Home has fallen back to
Android's chooser. If the TV is unreachable, its own
Settings → Apps page can re-enable packages too.

## When something goes wrong

The full list of things that bit us is in [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md). The
three that matter most:

- **macOS blocks `adb connect`** ("No route to host") under Local Network privacy. `tools/tv.py` avoids the binary.
- **Disable the stock launcher only after the new one is installed and running**, or Home lands on a factory test app. The install script orders this for you.
- **On Google TV the setup wizard** (`com.google.android.tungsten.setupwraith`) can take Home and crash-loop the system after the stock launcher is disabled. Disable it too, and list it in your `debloat.txt` so restore brings it back. But check `dumpsys wifi | grep -o 'cname=[^ ]*'` first: if the Wi-Fi network was saved during setup it belongs to setupwraith, and disabling it deletes the network (re-join it in Settings first; `tools/disable.sh` skips setupwraith until you do). On Google's own Chromecast it also costs phone casting, see [Troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md). Stuck already? `tools/tv.py 'pm enable --user 0 com.google.android.apps.tv.launcherx'`.

## Questions people ask

**Is this safe? Can it brick the TV?** Nothing is flashed, rooted or deleted; packages are disabled
in the user profile. The risk is disabling something the TV leans on, which is why lists are
applied in small batches with a restore script ready. The TV's own Settings → Apps page can
re-enable packages even without the tools.

**What about firmware updates?** Most lists disable the update service, so updates arrive only when
you re-enable it. If one lands, the worst case is a package coming back and you re-run the script.

**Won't the apps break?** Streaming apps still update through the Play Store, which is left alone.
The launcher just lists what is installed and launches it with intents that have been stable for a decade.

**Can I do this for someone in another home?** Yes, over a private [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com)
link instead of the same Wi-Fi: either Tailscale on their TV, shared with you, or a computer or Apple
TV at their home routing to it. Never by opening the ADB port on their router. Step by step in
[docs/REMOTE.md](docs/REMOTE.md).

**Isn't ADB access a security hole?** It is one explicit "allow this computer" tap on the TV, the
same as developing an Android app. Network ADB is plaintext on port 5555, and on firmware with
`ro.adb.secure=0` any device on the LAN gets a shell, so close it when you are done:

1. On the TV: Developer options → turn **USB debugging** and **Network/ADB debugging** off, and
   revoke the USB debugging authorisations.
2. Reboot the TV, then confirm the port is gone from your computer: `nc -vz <tv ip> 5555` must fail.
   Without `nc` (Windows): `python tools/adb-closed.py <tv ip>` must say the port is closed.

The launcher keeps working without debugging.

**Can it block ads inside apps too?** Partly, with Android's Private DNS (Android 9 and newer). Point
it at an ad-blocking resolver such as [AdGuard DNS](https://adguard-dns.io) and every app's ad and
tracker domains stop resolving, system-wide, surviving reboots. The trade-off: that resolver then
sees every DNS query the TV makes.

```bash
tools/tv.py 'settings put global private_dns_specifier dns.adguard-dns.com'
tools/tv.py 'settings put global private_dns_mode hostname'
```

It does not remove YouTube ads, which come from the same servers as the videos. If an app stops
playing or the TV reports "No internet" (the resolver is down or unreachable), switch back with
`tools/tv.py 'settings put global private_dns_mode opportunistic'`.

**AirPlay?** Not from this repo. Chromecast built-in stays for Android phones. For iPhones,
[jqssun/android-airplay-server](https://github.com/jqssun/android-airplay-server) works; an install
script for it is in [PR #84](https://github.com/Gathin23/cleanyourtv/pull/84).

**Can I just download the APK?** Build it with the one-line script; it takes a minute and you
control what goes on your TV. No prebuilt binaries.

## Contributing

The most useful contribution is your TV's debloat list, so the next person with that model does
not have to rediscover it. Launcher improvements and sharper prompt wording are welcome too.
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the format and the testing we ask for. Built something on
top, a launcher, a port, a theme? Add it to [SHOWCASE.md](SHOWCASE.md), where twenty-two projects already
live: a webOS port for LG, a Stremio shelf, a Hisense restyle, Fire TV launchers, an AirPlay installer.
